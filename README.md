Dynamic Dashboard - Adidas Sales Analysis

Designed and developed a dynamic dashboard to analyze Adidas sales data, uncovering actionable insights to drive performance and strategy.
Key highlights include:

Data Insights: Processed diverse datasets, including product categories, sales regions, and customer channels, to identify trends and performance variations across the West, Northeast, Southeast, Midwest, and South regions.  
Performance Analysis: Evaluated top-performing products, such as Men's Street Footwear (37,358 units sold), and identified areas with lower performance, like Men's Apparel (19,140 units sold).  
Sales Channel Optimization: Analyzed online, in-store, and outlet sales, discovering that online channels dominate across all regions, with the Southeast leading online sales.  
Retailer Insights: Highlighted retailer trends, including significant growth for Foot Locker and Sports Direct, and challenges faced by West Gear.  
Strategic Recommendations: Proposed focused investments in high-performing regions (West and Northeast), strategies to boost sales in underperforming areas (South), and tailored product offerings to align with customer preferences.  

This project demonstrates the power of interactive dashboards to enable Adidas to make data-driven decisions for optimizing sales performance and strategic growth.
